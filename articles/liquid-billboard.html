    <h2>Adidas Liquid Billboard</h2>
    <p>Adidas, Havas Middle East, and Jack Morton Middle East were awarded an ‘Outdoor’ Lion award at the 2022 Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity for their “Liquid Billboard” campaign. This ambitious advertisement successfully highlighted key social issues and promoted women’s rights and inclusivity. The authentic messaging and stunning creative visuals combined to bring incredulous attention, awareness, and interaction with progressive values, as well as the Adidas brand, within the Middle East and subsequently the whole world.</p>

    <h2>Adidas Empowering Women’s Rights</h2>
    <p>A multi-modal campaign challenging the oppressive tendencies of historical government policy in the Middle East could be seen as too politically volatile, perhaps damaging international contact relationships. However this was of no concern to the Adidas brand becoming strongly affiliated with these social values has tremendously positive effects on brand equity. The brand proposes itself as a helpful platform for social responsibility.</p>

    <p>Produced in the UAE, there is also a traditional billboard (Above) that Adidas uses to showcase all those who participate in their other ‘swimmable’ billboard. This campaign’s visual duality showcases exponential growth capabilities for outreach, and is mainly attributed to the cyclical nature of the “Liquid Billboard” encouraging User Generated Content which orbits social change. This is a core reason that Adidas was so successful and promoted inclusivity and women’s rights in an area infamous for doing the opposite. Adidas, Havas Middle East, and Jack Morton have completed a project so socially powerful that their Cannes Lions award is just a nod to the positive impact they have created in the Middle East.</p>
