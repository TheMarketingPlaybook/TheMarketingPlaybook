      <h2>Mattress Mack’s Background</h2>
      <p>James “Mattress Mack” McIngvale is a master marketer from Houston, Texas. He was born in 1951 and owns a very successful furniture store, Gallery Furniture, which employs several hundred people and has franchised into multiple locations since its creation in 1981.</p>
      <p>McIngvale lives for his business and its major significance within the Houston community, which has made him a role model in our current age of corporate progressiveness. A true local hero, he positions Gallery Furniture’s success to serve the community during both the best and worst of times.</p>

    <blockquote>“Living is giving”<br><em>– James McIngvale’s life motto</em></blockquote>

      <h2>How Mack Developed a Successful Business</h2>
      <p>In Gallery Furniture’s early days, McIngvale and his wife Linda struggled. With limited funds, they bet their final $10,000 on a bold 25-second TV ad—launching Mack’s high-energy pitch and introducing the world to his signature slogan:</p>

      <blockquote>“Gallery saves you… MONEY!”</blockquote>

      <p>This wasn’t just a marketing line—it became a symbol of authenticity, blending personal passion with community-centric storytelling. Inspired by Artie Grindle’s local TV energy, McIngvale became not just the face of the business, but the heart of it.</p>

      <h2>Mattress Mack Giving Back</h2>
      <p>Decades before “corporate social responsibility” was a buzzword, Mack was living it. From donating millions to cancer research and local charities to transforming Gallery Furniture into a shelter during Hurricane Harvey, Mack consistently put action before publicity.</p>

      <h2>World’s Biggest Bet Winner</h2>
      <p>In 2022, after the Houston Astros won the World Series, McIngvale claimed $75 million—the largest sports betting payout in history. But true to form, he used that windfall not for extravagance, but to refund customers who spent over $3,000 on mattresses. Straight refunds. No gimmicks.</p>

      <h2>Mattress Mack’s Methods</h2>
      <p>His marketing genius? Hedging bets by linking promos to game outcomes. If the team wins, customers get refunds. If the team loses, Gallery Furniture keeps the revenue. Either way, customers show up in droves—especially when Mack backs a Houston team.</p>
