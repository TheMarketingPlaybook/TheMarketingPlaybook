    <h2>What is the Purpose of AI?</h2>
    <p>At the core of artificial intelligence, it is a machine structured in logical inputs which then learns from its action’s outcomes. The machine makes a connection between outcomes and inputs by storing data on a spiderweb-like array of neural networking. This machine can then independently analyze large amounts data and execute the most desired actions, but that’s not important.</p>
    <p>As a marketer or entrepreneur, AI’s wide application range and newfound ability to produce results faster than ever before is paramount.</p>

    <h2>Marketers, Entrepreneurs, &amp; AI</h2>
    <p>The key to understanding market disruptors that derive from technological invention/innovation is not to fully immerse oneself within the tech and its insides. Rather, like Steve Balmer, look to the outside and fully comprehend the applications such tech could have in everyone’s every day life. It is best to spend time not only thinking about what this new tech could do to improve your own life, but also for one who lives both above and below your social or economic classes. Range your perspectives for useful applications of the tech by recalling anecdotal memories or knowledge of other regional cultures around the world. Consider the lives of those who reside in places that are centered around speed and efficiency like the cities of Japan and South Korea, to those whose life goal is to preserve longstanding legacies with tradition and methodical care like the citizens of Italy or Turkey.</p>
    <p>To name a few industries: healthcare is prime for an influx of artificial intelligence assistance, transportation is in dire need of efficiency improvement for global trade, finance sectors could task entry level employees with more attractive work by eliminating monotonous tasks, and lastly retail will have one more voice in the discussion of pricing products.</p>
    <p>However, it is digital marketing and data driven campaigns that will see the biggest impact from artificial intelligence. SEO optimization, predictive data analytics, automated A/B testing, personalized digital ads, and much more enhancement to our communication methods. Even greater, products like conversational AI or videogame NPC’s now have the viral ability to capture an entire market’s attention with the increased immersion.</p>

    <h2>The Future of AI</h2>
    <p>The three vital qualities to employ in the marketing future are: customer-centrism, long-term strategy, and comprehensive data analysis. The combination of these three aspects will allow for the experimentation of artificial intelligence to be much more effective, and its applicability far more engaging, when considering its usage in researching or developing campaigns.</p>
